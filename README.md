- 👋 Hi, I’m @tomarti31
- 👀 I’m interested in developing on the GitHub platform. I've spent some time with Python, JavaScript, and basic website creation, but I'm excited by the opportunities GitHub brings to the table and am excited to learn.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the GitHub language, as well as constantly developing and growing several personal projects through a diverse range of industries and topics, including music production for local artists, revolutionizing online shopping, investment/crypto/other financial areas, and work as an insurance agent for my resident state. Never a dull moment. :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects ongoing and completed through GitHub. As a relatively new coder, I'm ready to absorb any information I get to help me succeed. Otherwise, I'm a fairly "entrepreneurial spirit" and love to collab in any way possible!
- 📫 How to reach me: I can best be reached here, on BitCout @tomarti (check me out!! :D). Love to network, love to collab, and am very excited for what's to come.
